1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a
multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed 
in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

INPUT

#Assignment Q.no1
a = list(range(2000,3201))
m = []
for i in a:
#     print(i)
    if i % 7 == True and i % 5 == False:
         m.append(i)
print(m)

OUTPUT

[2010, 2045, 2080, 2115, 2150, 2185, 2220, 2255, 2290, 2325, 2360, 2395, 2430, 2465, 2500, 2535, 2570, 2605, 2640, 2675, 2710, 2745, 2780, 2815, 2850, 2885, 2920, 2955, 2990, 3025, 3060, 3095, 3130, 3165, 3200]

2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them
printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

INPUT
# Assignment Q.no2
#2.
a = input("Enter First Name: ")
b = input("Enter Last Name: ")
print(a[::-1],b[::-1])

OUTPUT

Enter First Name: Himanshu
Enter Last Name: Sharma
uhsnamiH amrahS

3. Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.Formula: V=4/3 * Ï€ * r 3

INPUT

#Assignment Q.no3
pi = 3.14
diameter = int(input("Enter the diameter: "))
radius = float(diameter/2)
volume = 4/3 * pi * radius ** 3
print("The volume of sphere with given diameter is {}".format(volume) )

OUTPUT
Enter the diameter: 12
The volume of sphere with given diameter is 904.3199999999999
